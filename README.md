Interact with the Paddle Billing API

A very lightweight library that doesn't force dependencies on you, only requires PSR-7 and PSR-18, so that you get to choose which implementations you want to use.

### Basic usage

First require `biohzrdmx/paddlin-php` with Composer.

Then you just need to create a `Paddlin\Client` instance, for that you must pass four parameters:

- An instance of an `Psr\Http\Client\ClientInterface` implementation
- An instance of an `Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestFactoryInterface` implementation
- An API key that you've created on your Paddle Dashboard
- A `bool` specifying whether to use the sandbox environment or not

For example, if you're using Guzzle you can use something like the following code:

```php
use Paddlin\Client;
use GuzzleHttp\Client as HttpClient;
use GuzzleHttp\Psr7\HttpFactory;

$http_factory = new HttpFactory();
$http_client = new HttpClient();
$client = new Client($http_client, $http_factory, 'YOUR_API_KEY', true);
```

Once you have a `Paddlin\Client` instance you can use any of the supported resources to interact with the API; so to get all of the products you may use the `list` method of the `products` resource:

```php
$products = $client->products->list();
```

If you want a single product, you may use the `get` method:

```php
$product = $client->products->get('pro_01gsz4t5hdjse780zja8vvr7jg');
```

To create a product you would use the `create` method, as shown in the next example:

```php
$payload = [
    "name" => "AeroEdit Student",
    "tax_category" => "standard",
    "description" => "Essential tools for student pilots to manage flight logs, analyze performance, and plan routes, and ensure compliance. Valid student pilot certificate from the FAA required.",
    "image_url" => "https://paddle.s3.amazonaws.com/user/165798/bT1XUOJAQhOUxGs83cbk_pro.png",
    "custom_data" => [
        "features" => [
            "aircraft_performance" => true,
            "compliance_monitoring" => false,
            "flight_log_management" => true,
            "payment_by_invoice" => false,
            "route_planning" => true,
            "sso" => false
        ],
        "suggested_addons" => [
            "pro_01h1vjes1y163xfj1rh1tkfb65",
            "pro_01gsz97mq9pa4fkyy0wqenepkz"
        ],
        "upgrade_description" => null
    ]
];
$client->products->create($payload);
```

And to update an existing product, the `update` method can be called as shown:

```php
$payload = [
  "name" => "AeroEdit for learner pilots"
];
$client->products->update('pro_01htz88xpr0mm7b3ta2pjkr7w2', $payload);
```

For more details on the available resources and its related data structures, check out the Paddle API reference: https://developer.paddle.com/api-reference/overview

_Note: Paddlin currently does not support the Reports, Events, Notifications nor Simulation resources._

#### Dot-notation access

Paddlin includes a handy feature to access the fields inside an entity, some of which may or may not be present; just call the `get` method using dot-notation, for example:

```php
$product = $client->products->get('pro_01gsz4t5hdjse780zja8vvr7jg');
$suggested_addons = $product->get('custom_data.features.suggested_addons');
```

You may also specify a default value should the specified one doesn't exist:

```php
$product = $client->products->get('pro_01gsz4t5hdjse780zja8vvr7jg');
$special_requirements = $product->get('custom_data.features.special_requirements', []); # Return an empty array instead of null if the key does not exist
```

### Verifying webhooks

You may verify your webhook notifications too, just create a `Paddlin\Webhook\Webhook` instance, passing the `$request` object (a `ServerRequestInterface` inmplementation) and your webhook secret:

```php
use Paddlin\Webhook\Webhook;

$webhook = new Webhook($request, 'YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET');
```

The first thing is to verify the webhook signature, to do so call the `verify` method:

```php
if ( $webhook->verify() ) {
    # The webhook is valid
}
```

And then get the related notification with the `getNotification` method:

```php
$notification = $webhook->getNotification();

switch($notification->event_type) {
    case 'subscription.created':
        # Process subscription.created event
    break;
}
```

For more details on the available events and its related notifications, check out the Paddle Webhooks reference: https://developer.paddle.com/webhooks/overview
